How ArrayList work?
--ArrayList in Java is an implementation of the List interface, and it is based on a dynamic array that grows or shrinks in size as elements are added or removed. The underlying data structure for ArrayList is an array.

Here's how ArrayList works internally:

-----Initialization:

---When you create an ArrayList, it starts with an initial capacity (the size of the internal array). By default, this capacity is set to 10 elements, but you can specify a different initial capacity when creating an ArrayList.
-------------Adding Elements:

---When you add an element to an ArrayList using the add method, the element is placed in the next available slot in the internal array.

--If the internal array is full when adding a new element, ArrayList creates a new array with a larger capacity (usually double the current capacity) and copies the elements from the old array to the new one. This process is known as "resizing."
Random Access:

--ArrayList provides fast random access to elements by their index. Accessing an element by index is a constant-time operation (O(1)) because it involves simple arithmetic to calculate the memory address of the element.

---------Removing Elements:

When you remove an element from an ArrayList using the remove method, the remaining elements are shifted to fill the gap.

ArrayList is not syncronised. It's equivalent is vector in java.

DIFFERENT WAYS TO IMPLEMENT ARRAYLIST: 

Standard ArrayList:
java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;

// Creating an ArrayList of Strings
ArrayList<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();

// Adding elements to the ArrayList
stringList.add("Element 1");
stringList.add("Element 2");
2. Initializing with Elements:
java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

// Initializing ArrayList with elements
ArrayList<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
3. Using Diamond Operator (Java 7+):
java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;

// Using the diamond operator (Java 7+)
ArrayList<Double> doubleList = new ArrayList<>();
4. List Interface (Polymorphism):
java
Copy code
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

// Using List interface for polymorphism
List<Character> charList = new ArrayList<>();
5. Copying from Another List:
java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Copying from another List
List<String> originalList = new ArrayList<>();
originalList.add("One");
originalList.add("Two");

ArrayList<String> copiedList = new ArrayList<>(originalList);
6. Java 10+ Using List.of:
java
Copy code
import java.util.List;

// Using List.of in Java 10+
List<String> immutableList = List.of("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");
ArrayList<String> mutableList = new ArrayList<>(immutableList);
Note:
The ArrayList class itself provides various constructors and methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements.

The examples above demonstrate different ways to create an ArrayList and initialize it with elements.

Choose the approach that best fits your specific use case and coding style. The most common approach is to use the standard ArrayList class.
