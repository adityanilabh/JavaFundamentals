1. Collection framework was introduced in JDK 1.2
2. The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.
3. java collection is a framework where set of classes and interface is already made.
    we just have to implement it in our class or code.
4. Before JDK 1.2, vectors arrays were used .
5. Iterable interface is the root interface for the entire collection framework. The collection interface extends the iterable interface.

6. In Java, when you declare a variable, you use the interface type on the left-hand side and the implementing class on the right-hand side. This allows you to take advantage of polymorphism, where you can use any class that implements the specified interface.
