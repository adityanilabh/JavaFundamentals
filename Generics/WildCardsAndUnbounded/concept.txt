The question mark (?) is known as the wildcard in generic programming.
 It represents an unknown type. The wildcard can be used in a variety of 
 situations such as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable; 
 sometimes as a return type. Unlike arrays, different instantiations of 
 a generic type are not compatible with each other, not even explicitly. 
 This incompatibility may be softened by the wildcard if ? is used as an 
 actual type parameter.

 Types of wildcards in Java

1. Upper Bounded Wildcards: 

These wildcards can be used when you want to relax the restrictions on a 
variable. For example, say you want to write a method that works on List 
< Integer >, List < Double >, and List < Number >, you can do this using an 
upper bounded wildcard. 

To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character (‘?’), 
followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound. 
Example: 
public static void add(List<? extends Number> list)


2. Lower Bounded Wildcards: 
It is expressed using the wildcard character (‘?’), followed by the
 super keyword, followed by its lower bound: <? super A>.
