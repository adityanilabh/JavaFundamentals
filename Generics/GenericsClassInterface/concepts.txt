=========================================================================
Terms:
Type Argument:

A type that is substituted for a type parameter in a generic class or method. 
It specifies the actual type to be used in place of the generic type parameter.
Parameterized Type:

A class or interface that has one or more type parameters. It is a generic class or 
interface where actual types are specified using type arguments.
Type Erasure:

The process by which the compiler removes or replaces generic type information during
 compilation. This is done to support backward compatibility with pre-existing code 
 that does not use generics.
