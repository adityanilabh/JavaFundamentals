okie so tell me generics came to overcome this in collection of java right?

Yes, exactly! Generics in Java were introduced primarily to overcome issues 
related to type safety and provide a more structured and safer way to work 
with collections.

Before generics were introduced (prior to Java 5), collections in Java, 
such as List, Set, and Map, were not type-safe. They could store elements 
of any type, and developers had to use explicit casting when retrieving elements. 
This lack of type safety often led to runtime errors, as the compiler couldn't 
enforce the correct usage of types.

Generics address this by allowing developers to specify the type of elements a 
collection or class can hold. This information is known at compile time, and 
the compiler ensures that only elements of the specified type can be added to 
or retrieved from the collection. This results in more readable, maintainable, 
and safer code.

In summary, generics in Java provide a way to create type-safe collections and 
classes, improving the reliability of code, especially in scenarios involving 
collections.








Q> so but later it was also introduced to class interface etc? right?

Yes, that's correct! While generics were initially introduced to improve 
type safety in collections, their usage was later extended to classes, interfaces, 
and methods as well. Generics offer a way to create reusable and type-safe code 
across various programming constructs.

Here are some key areas where generics are commonly used:

--------Generics in Classes and Interfaces----------

You can define classes and interfaces with generic types, allowing them to work 
with different data types.
For example, you can create a generic class like Box<T> that can hold objects 
of any type.

----------Generics in Methods-------------

Methods can be generic, allowing them to work with different types of parameters.
For example, you can create a generic method to find the maximum of two values, 
and it will work for any comparable data type.

----------Generics in Interfaces and Implementations------------

Generics are often used in interfaces to define a contract that works with 
different types, and classes implementing these interfaces specify the actual 
types.

-----------Generics in Collections (continued)--------------

Generics remain a crucial part of Java's collection framework, ensuring type 
safety in lists, sets, maps, and other data structures.
