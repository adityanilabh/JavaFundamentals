OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use 
objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. 
 are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks assigned by you. Object-oriented 
 programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, 
 polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the 
 data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code 
 can access this data except that function. 

 ======================================================================

 For every class and method let's consider this point: 

 Access Modifier: Defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can 
 be accessed in your application. In Java, there are 4 types of access specifiers: 
1. public: Accessible in all classes in your application.
2. protected: Accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its 
   subclass(es) (including subclasses declared outside the package).
3. private: Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
4. default (declared/defined without using any modifier): Accessible within 
   the same class and package within which its class is defined.

The return type: The data type of the value returned by the method or void if it 
does not return a value.
Method Name: The rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the 
convention is a little different.
Parameter list: Comma-separated list of the input parameters that are defined,
preceded by their data type, within the enclosed parentheses. If there are no 
parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().
Exception list: The exceptions you expect the method to throw. You can specify 
these exception(s).
Method body: It is the block of code, enclosed between braces, that you need to 
execute to perform your intended operations.
